title: Our Voices
short_description: Empowering New Zealand's young people to share their stories
description: Our Voices is about empowering New Zealand's young people to share their stories. This film aims to provide some insight into the range of issues facing our young people and to inspire people to speak up and have their voices heard. This film came out of the film workshop we ran at JustSpeak's 2013 camp. It was made in mere hours by an amazing group of young people from all over the country. Some of the stories are real, and some are fictional though based on real experiences. We hope the film gives you some insight into the range of issues facing our young people and some inspiration to simply speak up and have your voice heard.
