title: "St Vincent de Paul Society of Wellington"
short_description: "A short film for the St. Vincent de Paul Society of Wellington showcasing the work they do"
long_description: "For close to 150 years the St. Vincent de Paul Society has provided much needed services to those in need. This film celebrates the enthusiasm of the organisationâ€™s volunteers (the vincentians) by showcasing some of the diverse services they provide. Most of us recognise Vinnies through the windows of their second hand shops. Come in for a closer look, you might be pleasantly surprised...

The film will be used in-house to offer current and future vincentians rich and varied opportunities of work under the auspice of St. Vincent de Paul."
