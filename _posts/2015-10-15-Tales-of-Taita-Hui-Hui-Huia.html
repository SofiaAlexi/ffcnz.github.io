title: Tales of Taita - Hui Hui Huia
short_description: Two huia birds try to stay together against all odds
description: We ran a kids film-making workshop in the Taita - Pomare community where children learned about storytelling, using film-making equipment and finally made two films based on local legends. This is the second of their films. One of the young ladies on the team was called Huia-Jade, and there were two Huia birds in the karakia we started and ended each workshop with. It is also said that some of the last huia birds in New Zealand were seen around the Taita-Pomare area before they became extinct.
