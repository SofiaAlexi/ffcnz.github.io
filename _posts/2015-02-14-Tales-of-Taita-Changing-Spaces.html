title: Tales of Taita - Changing Spaces
short_description: The transformation of the Taita-Pomare Youth Hub from a derelict tennis club.
description: Approached by community weaver Sue Rei, this was one of the first projects Helen and Jesse took on. It was filmed over about half a year, and the process saw us embedded with the community out there. From this project sprung a whole host of projects with the Taita-Pomare community, and led to our larger project around the Walter Nash Stadium arts projects. This film is a key part of Film for Changeâ€™s history and a pretty powerful story about community change.
