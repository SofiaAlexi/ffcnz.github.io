They have helped thousands of people realise their potential, through their funding database and now they need your help. Generosity New Zealand are fundraising for a new platform so that they can provide a better search engine and user experience for their customers.
Finding funding is one of the hardest jobs, and GNZ want to make it easier and faster. But they can’t do this without your help."
