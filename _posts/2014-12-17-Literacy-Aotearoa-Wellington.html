title: Literacy Aotearoa Wellington
short_description: The empowering work of Literacy Aotearoa Wellington
description: We collaborated with Literacy Aotearoa Wellington to reflect and promote their empowering work in a film which would be accessible to those who needed their services. This was one of the first projects Jesse and Helen approached. After seeing their website which consisted entirely of written content, it made sense for us to help get their message out with this short film. Our amazing volunteer Rowan and his team took this project on and we left them to it and are pretty stoked with the outcome.
