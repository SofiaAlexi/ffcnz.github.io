title: "Generosity New Zealand"
short_description: "An animated and informative introduction to Generosity New Zealand"
description: "Generosity NZ  needed a short instructional film to go on their website. The main purpose being to inform people about what it is GNZ do, and more importantly what it is they don't do.  They're often misunderstood as an organisation that provides funding, and we wanted to dispel that myth while letting people know how they assist fund seekers."
