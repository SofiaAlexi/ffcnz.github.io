description: "This short film was commissioned by the Diana Unwin Chair in Restorative Justice at Victoria University alongside the build of this digital meeting space. The design of the video was carefully matched to the design of the website, and the narrator was chosen for his highly recognisable voice and links to the sector. From brief to completion this took a few months with a very small team. The video is now on the following website: https://restorativecommunity.org.nz"
