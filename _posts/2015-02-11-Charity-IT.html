title: Charity IT Hackathon
short_description: A short film about the Charity-IT Hackathon events
description: In 2014, we participated in the Charity-IT Hackathon event over one weekend. In that time, the IT experts in our group rebuilt our entire website, so we repaid their awesome contribution by making them this animated promo about what they do. Charity IT wanted a short film to attract more volunteers in the IT community, and we achieved this by explaining the process of the Hackathons in a way that conveys the sense of value that people get from the experience, and they value they share with others. This film was our first animation project, and it was a lot of fun to make. Charity-IT uses this film in presentations, in the media, and it was even viewed by people overseas who ended up collaborating with them.
