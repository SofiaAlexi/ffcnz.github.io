title: "The New Work Order - A presentation by Jan Owen"
short_description: "Every young person and everyone who knows a young person should watch this. The workforce and the way people work is changing and we need to be ready. This presentation covers some of the key findings from research by the Foundation for Young Australians.

The J R McKenzie Trust and the Ministry of Youth Development present 'The New Work Order', a presentation by Jan Owen AM Hon DLitt, CEO - Foundation for Young Australians.

On the 15 May 2017 this presentation was given on the challenges and opportunities facing young people today and in the future, including recent research on the future of work and the new work mindset.

'We know that the social, cultural and environmental landscapes in New Zealand, and worldwide, are rapidly evolving, and we must position our young people to manage this in a capable and assertive manner. Young New Zealanders will need to be self-assured, connected, resourceful, pioneering, positive and resilient if they are to contribute and thrive. It’s our intention that this presentation and workshop will help shed some light on how best to support them on this journey.'

Film for Change Aotearoa were asked to film this hour and a half long workshop and edit it down to its key points. This is one of the longest short films we've made, but getting an hour and a half long presentation down to 18 minutes of key points was pretty good we think!"
