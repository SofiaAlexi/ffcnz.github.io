title: Johnsonville Mural Project
short_description: A short film about the mural celebrating the local history of Johnsonville
description: We documented the process of designing and creating the Johnsonville mural over a period of months. Though the muralâ€™s creation was lead by Sheyne Tuffery, a vital element of the project was showing how it involved the community in the process, and as a result, the mural became more than just a series of paintings; it became a reflection of the people of Johnsonville.
