description: The Tumeke Taita Summer Festival is an annual celebration of the local community, which invites everyone to come together for a day of festivities. This short film shows only a small sampling of the event, as the actual thing is bigger and more varied than can be contained on screen. There’s fun and excitement to be had for all ages, and it’s a great way to feel like a part of this happy, friendly community.
