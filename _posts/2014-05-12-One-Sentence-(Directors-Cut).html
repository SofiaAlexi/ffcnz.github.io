short_description: Our 48 Hours 2014 film made in partnership with JustSpeak
description: JustSpeak's entry in 48 Hours 2014, from Wellington, New Zealand. This film was a joint project of JustSpeak and Film for Change Aotearoa. Making this film with the kaupapa of a charity in mind was a fun extra challenge. The great thing about this project was that we had a fantastic guaranteed audience for the film, to whom we conveyed a message of positivity in an enjoyable format.
