short_description: Website guide videos for the Disabled Persons Assembly
description: We created these short films for the new Disabled Persons Assembly website. Each video is signed, spoken and subtitled to ensure they are all accessible. This project saw every page on the DPA website with a short explanatory video, making the web content accessible. A few of our films are still on several of the pages, but as time has gone by and the website has been updated some have been removed.
