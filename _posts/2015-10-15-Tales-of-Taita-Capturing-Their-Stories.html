title: Tales of Taita - Capturing Their Stories
short_description: A film about Film for Change running filmmaking workshops for kids in Taita
description: In 2015, we ran a series of workshops teaching kids in the Taita Pomare area how to make films, whilst simultaneously making a film ourselves about the filmmaking workshops. This short documentary gives you a behind the scenes view into how we involved some young people in their history, legends and gave them the skills to share their stories through film.
